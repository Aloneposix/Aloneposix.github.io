I have always been interested and curious about the computer graphics area, trying to understand the whole process involved in rendering a simple 3D object. How could millions of meaningless numbers be drawn on the screen, with animations, lighting, textures and everything?

To start getting a little more aware of the subject, I started reading the book Introduction To 3D Game Programming With Directx 9.0C: A Shader Approach. This book covers from basic concepts (example of what a 3D object is) to even more advanced concepts, such as the use of Shaders (reason for my choice).
